= A LaTeX template for responding to reviewers

This repository contains a simple LaTeX template and a couple of helper
scripts for writing responses to reviewer comments on an academic
manuscript.

The LaTeX file defines environments `\rcomment` and `\response`, designed
to contain reviewer comments and responses respectively.

For brief, minor comments related to a particular line number (e.g.
corrections to typographical errors), it is more convenient to present the
comments and responses in a table. For formatting such tables, the
repository contains a Python script `makeresp.py` to generate LaTeX
source code for a table from a lightly formatted text input file.
